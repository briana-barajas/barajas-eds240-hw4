## Prep for Assignment 4

1.  *Which option do you plan to pursue?*

    **ANS:**

2.  Restate your question(s). Has this changed at all since HW #1? If yes, how so?

3.  Explain which variables from your data set(s) you will use to answer your question(s).

4.  In HW #2, you should have created some exploratory data viz to better understand your data. You may already have some ideas of how you plan to formally visualize your data, but it\'s *incredibly* helpful to look at visualizations by other creators for inspiration. Find at least two data visualizations that you could (potentially) borrow / adapt pieces from. Link to them or download and embed them into your `.qmd` file, and explain which elements you might borrow (e.g. the graphic form, legend design, layout, etc.).

5.  Hand-draw your anticipated three visualizations (option 1) or infographic (option 2). Take a photo of your drawing and embed it in your rendered `.qmd` file -- **note** that these are not *exploratory* visualizations, but rather your plan for your final visualizations that you will eventually polish and submit with HW #4

6.  Mock up your visualizations using code. We understand that you will continue to iterate on these into HW #4 (particularly after receiving feedback), but by the end of HW #3, you should:

    -   have your data plotted (if you\'re experimenting with an advanced graphic form(s) that were not explicitly covered in class, we understand that this may take some more time to build; you should have as much put together as possible)

    -   use appropriate strategies to highlight / focus attention on a clear message

    -   include appropriate text such as titles, captions, axis labels

    -   experiment with colors and typefaces / fonts

    -   create a presentable / aesthetically-pleasing theme (e.g. (re)move gridlines / legends as appropriate, adjust font sizes, etc.)

## Additional Questions

1.  What challenges did you encounter or anticipate encountering as you continue to build / iterate on your visualizations in R?
2.  What ggplot extension tools / packages do you need to use to build your visualizations? Are there any that we haven\'t covered in class that you\'ll be learning how to use for your visualizations?
3.  What feedback do you need from the instructional team and / or your peers to ensure that your intended message is clear
